## Notes:
- 03-Feb-2023: To help manage python versions, I use pyenv.  Please see: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-manage-multiple-python-versions-on-an-apple-silicon-m1-mac-d69ee6ed0250
  This allows me to switch to older versions (ie 3.7) for other cli's like gcloud seamlessly.
- 15-Nov-2022: The Azure CLI is VERY DELICATE when it comes to python on iOS.  Python-3.10.1 is one of the latest, and works well.   BE CAREFULL updating your system if you are on python-3.5.x or older.  Many things use python.
